# Chrismess

The first project for Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 3. This project uses vanilla JavaScript/ES2015+.

## Day 2 Homework

* Give the function `changeHeading` a more accurate name.
* Add a second field to the form.
* Display the value of that field in the list.

## Bonus Credit

* Display the second field in a separate HTML element than the flick name. For example:

```html
<li>
  <span class="flickName">Jurassic Work</span>
  <span class="year">2015</span>
</li>
```

* See if you can then style each field differently.

## Super Mega Bonus Credit

* Use more than one function. (Break `changeHeading` into multiple functions, as appropriate.)
